# Advanced Settings

If you are not familiar with advanced settings of uBlock Origin, 
[**please read this first**](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Advanced-settings). 

## Differences

In Nano Adblocker, most of the advanced settings are the same as uBlock Origin, however, the default value of some settings are 
different: 
- `assetFetchTimeout` defaults to `60`
- `autoUpdateAssetFetchPeriod` defaults to `300` <sup>1</sup>
- `autoUpdatePeriod` defaults to `4`
- `manualUpdateAssetFetchPeriod` defaults to `1` <sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> When fetching assets, you should either get them all done in one burst or wait a significant delay between them. It is 
expensive to keep sockets open and it is even more expensive to create new ones. In fact, holding sockets open is how 
[Slowloris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_(computer_security)) attacks are carried out. 

Beside different defaults, Nano Adblocker also offers a few more functionalities in the advanced settings page. These advanced 
functionalities **can change or break at any time**, make sure to back up your settings if you want to play around with them. Please 
open an issue when they break for you, or otherwise behave in a way that contradicts the description below. We cannot fix issues 
that we are not aware of, so please take the time to report them! 

## Extra Functionalities

When a functionality is marked as `[unavailable]`, it may show in the advanced settings page, but will not work at all, not 
work as expected, or cause breakage when touched. 

When a functionality is marked as `[experimental]`, it may work properly, work sometimes, not work at all, not work as expected, or 
cause breakage when touched. 

Even when a functionality is considered stable, it is not guaranteed to always work. **Use at your own risk!** 

### `_nanoRestart` invokable

Available since 1.0.0.29

When invoked, Nano Adblocker will restart. **Any unsaved changes will be discarded** during the restart and all opened extension 
pages will be closed. 

### `_nanoForceRecompile` invokable

Available since 1.0.0.22

When invoked, Nano Adblocker will discard compiled filters and internal selfies then restart, during which *all* filters will be 
recompiled. **Any unsaved changes will be discarded** during the restart and all opened extension pages will be closed. 

### `_nanoAttemptPolyfillHTMLFiltering` toggleable `[unavailable]`

Default: `false`

When set to `true`, Nano Adblocker will attempt to polyfill request body filtering for (only) browsers that are *marked* as do not 
natively support it. The polyfill is less reliable and consumes more resource. 

### `_nanoDisableHTMLFiltering` toggleable `[experimental]`

Available since 1.0.0.29

Default: ~~`false`~~ Temporarily set to `true` due to some upstream bugs

When set to `true`, Nano Adblocker will *mark* the browser as does not support native request body filtering regardless whether it 
actually supports it. An extension restart is required. This settings is **not** affected by whether advanced mode is on. 

### `_nanoDisconnectFrom_jspenguincom` toggleable `[unavailable]`

Default: `false`

*Note: Nano Adblocker does not connect to `jspenguin.com` yet; this option will become available as soon as it does.*

When set to `true`, Nano Adblocker will no longer send background requests to `jspenguin.com`. Consequently, some default filters and 
internal assets will update up to 5 times *less* frequently and you can no longer report broken websites from the popup panel. 

### `_nanoIgnorePerformanceAuditing` toggleable `[unavailable]`

Default: `false`

When set to `true`, Nano Adblocker will no longer discard slow filter rules from `My filters` when compiling filters **in the 
future**. Similarly, setting this toggle to `false` **or turning off advanced mode** will **not** cause slow filters to be 
immediately removed. 

Performance *will* be flushed down the toilet if not used properly, make sure you have a *really* fast computer when playing 
around with this settings. 

### `_nanoIgnoreThirdPartyWhitelist` toggleable `[experimental]`

Available since 1.0.0.22

Default: `false`

When set to `true`, Nano Adblocker will discard exception and `badfilter` rules from all filter lists except `My filters` when 
compiling filters **in the future**. Similarly, setting this toggle to `false` **or turning off advanced mode** will **not** 
cause discarded filters to be immediately restored. 

Negated domains are sometimes transformed into exception rules, and they will not be affected **for now**. This is really hard to 
fix due to the parsing logic is not designed with discarding whitelists in mind. 

Setting this toggle to `true` **will definitely** break *many* websites and you are to fix them **by yourself**. 

### `_nanoMakeUserFiltersPrivileged` toggleable

Available since 1.0.0.22

Default: `false`

When set to `true`, Nano Adblocker will treat user filters as a privileged filter when compiling filters **in the future**. Similarly, 
setting this toggle to `false` **or turning off advanced mode** will **not** cause privileged filters to be immediately removed. 

Privileged filters have access to experimental syntax features **if there are any**. Nano Adblocker's own filters (Nano filters) 
are always privileged.
